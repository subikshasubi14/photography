        <h2 class="wp-block-heading" ><span class="ez-toc-section" style="background-color:rgb(238, 114, 211);"> What is Photography?</label></h2>
        <p><strong>Photography is the art of capturing and processing light using a sensor or film. But the essence of photography is to treasure moments and share them with the world. Quite simple, but the action itself is capable of changing people&#8217;s perceptions.</strong></p>
        <p>A photo can have a deeper meaning and tell thousands of important stories. One of the best examples is photos taken during the war.</p>
        <p>There are many eye-opening photos circulated during the war.</p>
        <p>Some photos snap the winners&#8217; glorious moments while others show the utter devastation of citizens caught in the crossfire.</p>
        <p><strong>But that&#8217;s not all, folks; photography also has the nature of having multiple interpretations, especially in modern photography and art.</strong></p>
        <p>Everyone has their own &#8220;hot take&#8221; when it comes to judging an image. Some see the bigger &#8220;picture,&#8221; while others take it as an analogy to life, transforming it into those &#8220;wise&#8221; quotes.</p>
        <p>As you widen your knowledge about photography, aesthetics, and techniques, you can unveil even more meaning behind a single photograph.</p>
        <h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" < style="background-color:rgb(238, 114, 211);"> What Is the Purpose of Photography?</h2>
        <p>The purpose of photography is to capture and preserve moments and memories, communicate ideas and emotions, and document events, people, and places.</p>
        <p>Photography can be used for a variety of purposes, including artistic expression, journalism, scientific research, advertising, and commercial use. It can be used to capture the beauty of nature, document social and political issues, tell a story, or convey a message.</p>
        <p>It can be used to bring people together and to tear people apart.</p>
        <p>Photographs are used for many things.</p>
        <p>In the past, photography’s purpose was to supply portraits  for people who could not afford paintings. </p>
        <p>During War, photographs enable people to grieve and remember their family members who passed away on the battlefield.</p>
        <p>Lovers can also use a photograph to soothe the suffocating pain of missing their loved ones on a cold night.</p>
        <p><strong>As time goes by, photography serves more diverse purposes. You can see this with all the different niches of photography</a>.</strong></p>
        <p>Product photography is based on the sole purpose of selling a product such as food. The photographer should make every item of food and beverage look shinier, mouth-watering, and more delicious than its competitors.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, portrait photography aims to tell a story about an individual’s identity, personality, and story. </p>
        <p>This style is divided into several more types, such as lifestyle portraits, street portraits, and many more, each of which has a different purpose.</p>
        <p>For hobbyist photographers and regular people, photography is a way to document meaningful moments in life—memories stored indefinitely in a picture, which you can look back at easily anytime.</p>

        <h2 class="wp-block-heading" ><span class="ez-toc-section" style="background-color:rgb(238, 114, 211);"> What Are the Different Types Of Photography?</h2>
        <p>There are over 60 different types of photography, but we will only describe the most common ones. Here is a brief explanation of the 8 most common photography styles along with their respective resource hub.</p>
       
        <h3<strong>1. Portrait Photography</strong></h3>
    
        <p>Everyone in any setting can be the subject of portrait photography; from your family at home, friends in school, co-workers in the office, and even yourself. You can shoot your subject either posed, candid or close-ups.</p>
        <p>Even though this style looks super simple to do, some photographers struggle to shoot a good one. </p>
        <p>The common reason is they cannot make the subject feel comfortable posing in front of the camera. Therefore, the subject looks awkward and unnatural.</p>
        <p>When shooting a portrait, keep in mind that your subject is an ordinary human with a set of emotions and thoughts. Try to interact with them in the most relaxed manner to make them feel confident and show their true self.</p>
        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-6c6453b7 gb-headline-text"><strong>2. Headshot Photography</strong>

        <h4>Everyone is always in need of a high-quality headshot, whether it be for personal or professional reasons, so if you can master your headshot photography technique, you can make a great living as a photographer.</h4>
        <p>Professional headshots are a type of portrait photography typically used for websites, press releases, publications, and social-media profiles. The term “headshot” or “head shot” just means that the portrait photo is cropped somewhere in the middle torso – so that the focus is on your face.</p>
        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-26ac0cf9 gb-headline-text"><strong>3. Fashion Photography</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Fashion photography photos are the pictures you see in a fashion magazine or online shop. </strong></p>
        
        <p>This photography style has one sole purpose: making every fashion item </p>
        <p>Fashion photographers should master portrait photographer skills, possess tons of <a href target="_blank" rel="noopener">creative</a> ideas in the back of their heads, and love to collaborate with stylists, creative directors, models, and other crew members.</p>
        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-7f776702 gb-headline-text"><strong>4. Food Photography</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>The main goal of food photography is to promote the products and entice customers to buy them. </strong></p>
        <p>No matter how small or large the scale is, every food and beverage business will need this type of photography.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You will need a lot of money to build a career in this industry since professional food photography needs a studio and other special equipment.<br>&nbsp;<br>It means that this industry is promising, especially in the age of the internet, just like now.</p>
        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-160c8582 gb-headline-text"><strong>5. Editorial Photography</strong></h3>
        
        <p>The photo makes the reader understand more about the description of events, places, or stories that the writer tries to tell.</p>
        <p>If you want to be an editorial photographer, you need a deeper understanding of the subject, composition, and advanced technique.</p>
        <p>As a photographer, you should have a high sensitivity to know which angle or subject best represents the story that a writer writes.</p>
        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-d2dfabad gb-headline-text"><strong>6. Architectural Photography</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>The interior and exterior of buildings are the main subjects for architectural photographers.</strong></p>

        <p>This style is particular because it only focuses on capturing architectural beauty, which sometimes is hidden in plain sight.</p>
        <p>This style aims to shoot the utmost detail of buildings and promote it to potential buyers. It is like product photography with a different subject.</p>
        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-598f6f4a gb-headline-text"><strong>7. Landscape Photography</strong></h3>
        
        <p>Landscape photographers often use higher-end cameras and tools to acquire the best photos.</p>
        
        <p>A busy city full of working-class people during the day or glamorous 
        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-f1e73008 gb-headline-text"><strong>8. Event Photography</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>As the name implies, this type of photography focuses on capturing every exciting moment in an event, from a wedding, birthday celebration, family gathering, annual meeting in the office, and many more.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Event photographers’ services are always in high demand. The average fee is around $200-280 but can be vary depending on how long your event held.</p>
        <p>But do not worry too much because their rates are adjustable. It depends on your request, the event&#8217;s location, and your personal preference that may require the photographer to use additional equipment or staff.</p>
        
        <p>A great street photographer is one who can capture emotions and expressions while staying relatively inconspicuous.</p>
        <p>There is nothing worse than sticking a camera in a stranger&#8217;s face.</p>
        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-485be7b7 gb-headline-text"><strong>10. Sports Photography</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>As the name implies, sports photography focuses on capturing the live action of a sporting event. Whether it be actionable moments during the sport or the players within the sport.</strong></p>
       
        <p>Sports photography is an exciting genre of photography, especially if you are a fan of the sport you are photographing! </p>
        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-0e6c0752 gb-headline-text"><strong>11. Product Photography</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Product photography focuses on products as the main subject, capturing the detail of the product and its features.</strong></p>
        <p>The products you photograph can vary from eCommerce items to jewelry, to toys.</p>
        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-f5713175 gb-headline-text"><strong>12. Wildlife Photography</strong></h3>
        
        <p>This type of photography can be dangerous, so make sure you come well-prepared!</p>
        <p>How can it be dangerous you may ask?</p>
        <p>Wildlife photography can be dangerous due to the physical harm that can be caused by animals, such as bears or venomous snakes, or environmental hazards, such as rough terrain or extreme weather conditions. </p>
        <p>Additionally, the pursuit of the perfect shot can lead to reckless behavior, such as getting too close to animals or disturbing their natural habitat, which can be harmful to both the photographer and the wildlife. It is important for wildlife photographers to be aware of these risks and take appropriate safety precautions.</p>
        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-20d3b5ec gb-headline-text"><strong>13. Lifestyle Photography</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Lifestyle photography is like a portrait photo, except it has the particular goal of capturing one&#8217;s &#8220;lifestyle.&#8221; The photographer captures the subject during these moments. </strong></p>
        <p>Examples of lifestyle photos can include the subject doing yoga, working at a desk, laughing with friends, working at a coffee shop, etc. </p>
        <p>Ever since the prominence of social media people want to showcase their lifestyle to their friends and family.</p>
        <h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="What_Do_You_Need_for_Photography"></span><strong>What Do You Need for Photography?</strong><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Camera and Photography Gear</h3>
        <p>I’d say that you will need a  </p>
        <p>Renting a DSLR or ;</p>
        <p><strong>Nevertheless, before buying any camera or other equipment, you should decide which photography career you want to pursue. </strong></p>
        <p>Do you want to target a small niche? Or do you want to invent a brand-new photography style? By answering basic questions, you can decide which gear will support you best in this new career.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>For example, buying a tripod and multiple lenses for landscape photography, and investing in additional lighting will help those focusing on portrait photography.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Good Learning Foundation</h3>
        <p>As a beginner photographer, it is natural to make some mistakes. But do not fall into the same error twice. </p>
        <p>From the basic to the professional level, you can </p>
        <p><strong>Even most tutorial videos, blog posts, books, and other information about photography on the internet are free (such as our guides). </strong></p>
        <p>Take your time to learn it all to avoid making silly mistakes.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Last but not least is practice. Try different settings, angles, lighting setups, and everything to understand how things appear on the camera. The more hours you spend practicing, the better you will become.&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Editing Skills</h3>
        <p>If you want to step up your game, invest your time to master editing skills using Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom. Post-processing can help you patch up the little mistakes that you made and even make your subject appear more stunning than before.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, there’s equipment, knowledge, and also practice in both production and post-production.&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Being_Technical_Creative_and_Business_Savvy_in_Photography"></span><strong>Being Technical, Creative, and Business Savvy in Photography</strong><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
        <p><strong>Technical skill and creativity work together like clockwork: without one another, your images would end up dull, unattractive, and senseless.</strong></p>
        <p>To be a good photographer, you need to be technical, creative, and business savvy.</p>
        <p>Let&#8217;s cover what each of these means.</p>
        <h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Basics_of_Camera_Technology"></span>Basics of Camera Technology<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
        <p>The first thing you&#8217;ll need to understand when it comes to photography is how to use your camera!</p>
        <p>With that being said let&#8217;s cover the basics of camera technology.</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Types of Cameras</h3>
        <p>When it comes to cameras in photography, there are a good amount of choices. Let&#8217;s cover the most popular camera options:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Smartphone</li>
        <li>Point-and-Shoot Cameras</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on your needs and budget.</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Types of Lenses</h3>
        <p>The type of lens you choose depends on what your niche is and what subject you are trying to photograph.</p>
        <p>For example, I believe the best lenses for portraits are 50mm and 85mm lenses. The best lenses for street photography are 35mm and 50mm lenses. The best lenses for sports photography or wildlife photography are 85mm and longer. The best lenses for wedding and event photography are 35mm, 85mm, and 50mm lenses.</p>
        <p>The most important thing to know about lenses is that they come in a wide range of focal lengths and aperture sizes.</p>
        <p>To find the best lens for yourself, it&#8217;s important you first know what camera and brand you will be using, then research the best lenses for that camera based on your niche.</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Camera Sensors</h3>
        <p>The camera sensor is the part of the camera that captures the image.</p>
        <p>There are two main types of sensors: CCD (charge-coupled device) and CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor). CMOS sensors are now more commonly used in modern cameras, as they are more energy-efficient and produce less noise in low-light conditions.</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Image Stabilization</h3>
        <p>Image stabilization is a feature that is sometimes built into cameras and lenses.</p>
        <p>What image stabilization does is helps reduce the effects of camera shake and helps produce sharper-looking images.</p>
        <p>This can be especially useful in low-light or long-exposure situations.</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Autofocus</h3>
        <p>Most cameras that are modern have an autofocus system. This system combines sensors and algorithms within its processor to determine the optimal focal point for a given scene. Pretty cool stuff!</p>
        <p>Some cameras have more advanced autofocus systems than others, which can be useful for fast-moving subjects or challenging lighting conditions.</p>
        <p>Once you know the basics of camera technology, then it&#8217;s good to know the basics of photography composition.</p>
        <h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Photography_Composition_Techniques"></span>Photography Composition Techniques<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
        
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Rule of Thirds</h3>
        <p>The rule of thirds is one of the most basic principles of composition.</p>
        <p>You then place your main subject or focal point along one of the lines at an intersection point.</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Framing</h3>
        <p>Framing elements can include things such as doorways, windows, trees, arches, etc.</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Leading Lines</h3>
        <p>Examples of leading lines include roads, rivers, railway tracks, or fences.</p>
        <p>Once you understand the basics of composition, it&#8217;s important to know the basics of lighting and exposure</p>
        <h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Photography_Lighting_and_Exposure"></span>Photography Lighting and Exposure<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
        <p>In order to understand lighting and exposure in photography, it&#8217;s about knowing both the technical aspects of your camera, how to read a scene, and how to position your subject.</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Exposure Triangle</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The aperture controls the focus of the image while controlling the amount of light received.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>ISO is a sensitivity that allows you to take pictures in various types of lighting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Natural Lighting and Artificial Lighting in Photography</h3>
        <p>The two primary types of lighting in photography include natural and artificial lighting.</p>
        <p><strong>Natural lighting</strong> is the light that comes from the sun, moon, or stars. It changes throughout the day, depending on the time and weather conditions, and can create different moods and effects within an image. </p>
        <p><strong>Artificial lighting</strong> is any light source that is created by humans, such as lamps, light fixtures, or strobes. This type of lighting can be controlled and manipulated to achieve a specific effect or mood within an image and is often used for photograph</p>
